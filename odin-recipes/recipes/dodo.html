        <h3>Dodo (Fried ripe plantain) served on a wooden plate.</h3>
        <p>
            As yellow plantain ripens, its skin turns black. In this state, it could
            be mistaken for being past it or gone off.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, at this stage, it is, in many ways, at its best. Natural sugars
            develop when fried, caramelize into golden treats like no other. <br />
            In Nigeria, dodo is a classic snack because it goes with anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            They can also be sliced into elegant discs which are how we prefer them.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Top and tail the plantains, then make a skin-deep incision along the
                spine of each one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open the skin and remove the flesh. Slice diagonally into long discs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the plantain into a large bowl, add the cayenne pepper, a pinch of
                salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently massage with your hands so that each piece is equally covered
                with seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be gentle because the plantain can turn to mush if too much pressure
                is applied.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the sunflower oil into a wide frying pan</li>
            <li>Put the frying pan on medium heat.</li>
            <li>
                While the oil heats up, prepare a surface, rack, or plate covered with
                kitchen paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the oil is hot, test it with one of the plantain discs â€“ it should sizzle.
            </li>
            <li>Fry the plantain in batches by placing the discs in the frying pan face down, one by one. </li>
            <li>The oil should sizzle and you will see small bubbles around each disc. </li>
            <li>Do not let the discs overlap in the pan. </li>
            <li>
                After 2-3 minutes, turn over each disc using fork or a spatula.
            </li>
            <li>The plantain should be golden brown on the outside. </li>
            <li>Remove the discs from the pan one by one when each piece is cooked, and leave to rest on kitchen paper.
            </li>
            <li>Serve hot.</li>
            <li>Leave the oil to cool, then store in a sealed container. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p><strong>Frying on a very low heat will create oily plantain. </strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>The thinnest parts, around the edge of each disc, will fry much more quickly, and will therefore
                crisp up and turn darker.
        </strong> </p>
        <p><strong>It can be used again to fry plantain and will keep for a long time.</strong></p>
